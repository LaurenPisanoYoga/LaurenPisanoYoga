<p>Welcome and thank you. I am so happy that we’ve connected. If we haven’t met yet,
I hope to meet you very soon. I am blessed to serve as a yoga instructor in
San Francisco, California. I remain a student of my teachers Stephanie Adams,
Adi Vajra, Rusty Wells and Janet Stone.</p>

“Lifetimes of spiritual work and sadhana cannot accomplish what one single moment can show you when you are truly available. Let all your practices go, for just a moment, to see what in you has never required a practice.”
