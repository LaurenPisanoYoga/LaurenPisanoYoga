name: Lauren Pisano Yoga
bio: '<p>When we approach the practice as a creative expression, we are artists. We ignite the fire of creativity within ourselves and experience the teachings as they are; living, impermanent and ceaselessly transforming.</p>
<p>When we approach the practice as a discipline, we are held in the sacred tradition of yoga. We learn humility. We learn reverence. We learn what it means to be grounded.</p>
<p>My practice (and therefore, teaching) is a dance around this balance point between discipline and artistry. I offer what wisdom has been revealed to me in my journey, as it is natural and relevant to the moment I share with you in the yoga room. Classes are flowing, grounded and deliberate.</p>
<p>Adi Vajra and Stephanie Adams showed me what yoga is. My teaching is a tree grown in their soil.</p>
<p>Join or connect with me as it serves you. All are welcome. It is not important that you are perfect, only that you are sincere.</p>
<p>Yours truly, eternally in bloom,<br>
Lauren</p>'
